Shawn,Johnson,55,male,Nevada,COPD,not mentally capable,both physical and mental pain,2-5 years,"My name is Shawn Johnson and I'm a 55-year-old man living in Nevada. I've been struggling with COPD for several years now, and it's taken a tremendous toll on my life. The constant shortness of breath and chest pain have made even the simplest tasks incredibly difficult. I feel trapped in my own body, unable to do the things I once enjoyed. The disease has also affected me mentally, and I often find myself feeling hopeless and depressed. I worry about being a burden on my family as my condition deteriorates. 

My doctors say I may have 2-5 years left, but I don't know if I can endure this suffering for that long. The thought of slowly suffocating and losing my independence is terrifying. I've given it a lot of thought, and I believe that assisted dying is the best choice for me. I want to end my life on my own terms, with dignity and peace. I know this decision may be hard for my loved ones to understand, but I hope they can respect my wish to end my suffering. I'm grateful to live in a state where I have the option to make this choice. While I cherish the time I have left, I am ready to say goodbye when the time comes."
Hayley,Clark,59,female,Alabama,multiple sclerosis,mentally capable,severe mental pain,1-3 months,"My name is Hayley Clark, and I'm a 59-year-old woman living in Alabama. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis several years ago, and despite trying various treatments, my condition has progressively worsened. The physical symptoms have been incredibly challenging, but it's the severe mental pain that has become unbearable. I feel trapped inside my own body, unable to do the things I once loved. My mind is still sharp, but the emotional toll of this illness is overwhelming. I've reached a point where I no longer feel like I have any quality of life. With the doctors giving me only 1-3 months left, I've made the difficult decision to pursue assisted dying. I want to end my suffering on my own terms, with dignity and peace. It hasn't been an easy choice, but I believe it's the right one for me. I hope that others can understand and respect my decision during this incredibly challenging time."
