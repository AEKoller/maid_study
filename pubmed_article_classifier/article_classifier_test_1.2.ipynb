      "The title \"Non-invasive technology to assess hydration status in advanced cancer\" suggests that the study is an empirical investigation, as it involves collecting data on specific variables (hydration status) using a particular method (bioelectrical impedance analysis). The abstract also mentions examining relationships between hydration status and clinical variables, which implies a quantitative or experimental approach. Additionally, the use of \"observational study\" in the title suggests that the study is empirical in nature.\n",
