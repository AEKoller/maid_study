,39167528,10.1089/jpm.2023.0706,"** Randomized controlled survey study, patients with advanced illness, online survey administration","** The use of a randomized controlled design allows for the isolation of the effect of legalizing medical aid in dying on patient trust, while controlling for other potential variables. Conducting an online survey administration enables researchers to reach a large and diverse sample population, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. By targeting patients with advanced illness, the study focuses on a specific group that may be particularly affected by changes in end-of-life care policies.",** Empirical,"** The study is empirical because it involves collecting data through a survey study to investigate the impact of legalizing medical aid in dying on patient trust. The study aims to collect and analyze data from a sample population, rather than relying on theoretical models or simulations.",The Impact of Legalizing Medical Aid in Dying on Patient Trust: A Randomized Controlled Survey Study.
"Oral fluid intake decreases in advanced cancer in the dying phase of illness. There is inadequate evidence to support the assessment, and management, of hydration in the dying. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a body composition assessment tool. BIA has the potential to inform clinal management in advanced cancer, by examining the relationships between hydration status and clinical variables.",39160544,10.1186/s12904-024-01542-z,"** Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), observational study","** The use of BIA as a body composition assessment tool allows researchers to non-invasively measure changes in fluid status in advanced cancer patients. An observational study design enables the collection of data on clinical variables and hydration status, enabling the exploration of relationships between these factors.",** Empirical,"** The study is empirical because it involves collecting data through observational methods and statistical analysis to explore relationships between fluid status and symptoms in advanced cancer patients. The study aims to provide new insights into the assessment and management of hydration in this population, which is typical of empirical research.",Non-invasive technology to assess hydration status in advanced cancer to explore relationships between fluid status and symptoms: an observational study using bioelectrical impedance analysis.
"The death of a patient negatively affects the professional dimension of nurses' functioning and also their private lives, where professional experiences and emotions are often transmitted.",39157533,10.3389/fpubh.2024.1399025,"** Surveys, interviews","** The study likely employed surveys and interviews to gather data on the experiences and emotions of nurses after a patient's death. This combination of methods allows for both quantitative and qualitative data collection, which is useful in exploring the complex phenomenon of nurses' responses to patient death.",** Empirical,"** The study appears to be empirical because it investigates the experiences and emotions of nurses when faced with a patient's death, which suggests a quantitative or qualitative analysis of real-life data. The title ""Readiness of nurses when faced with a patient's death"" also implies an investigation into the phenomenon rather than a theoretical discussion.",Readiness of nurses when faced with a patient's death.
"The need for palliative care is ever-increasing globally. However, it is least developed or not available in most low-and-middle-income-countries including Bhutan.",39157418,10.1177/26323524241272102,"** Mixed-methods survey and interviews, with a total of 50 participants (34 surveys and 16 interviews)","** The use of mixed-methods research allows the authors to gather both quantitative and qualitative data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of healthcare professionals' perceptions on palliative care in Bhutan. The combination of survey and interview methods also enables the collection of both general attitudes and specific experiences, which can provide richer insights into the topic.",** Empirical,"** The study is empirical because it involves data collection and analysis from healthcare professionals in Bhutan, rather than relying solely on theoretical frameworks or literature reviews. The study's focus on exploring perceptions and experiences also suggests an empirical approach.",'There is no such word as palliative care for us at the moment': A mixed-method study exploring the perceptions of healthcare professionals on the need for palliative care in Bhutan.
"Patients with serious illness frequently report (temporary) wishes to hasten death. Even until the end-of-life, many patients also harbor a will to live. Although both phenomena are negatively correlated according to some studies, they can also co-exist. Knowledge about the complex relationship between the seemingly opposing wish to hasten death and will to live is limited, but crucial for delivering adequate care and understanding potential requests for assisted dying.",39152645,10.1177/02692163241269689,"** Mixed-methods study, secondary analysis of outlier patients","** The use of a mixed-methods approach allows the authors to combine both quantitative and qualitative data from the original study. By analyzing outlier patients, they can gain a deeper understanding of complex phenomena that may not be captured by typical statistical analyses. This methodological choice enables the researchers to explore the relationship between the wish to hasten death and the will to live in a nuanced way, which is particularly important given the abstract's focus on the coexistence of these seemingly opposing desires.",** Empirical,"** The study is empirical because it analyzes existing data from a mixed-methods study, rather than proposing or testing theoretical frameworks. The authors present findings based on their examination of outlier patients from an original study, suggesting that they are working with real-world data to explore the relationship between the wish to hasten death and the will to live.",The double awareness of the wish to hasten death and the will to live: A secondary analysis of outlier patients from a mixed-methods study.
