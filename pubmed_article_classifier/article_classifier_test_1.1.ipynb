      "The title \"Non-invasive technology to assess hydration status in advanced cancer\" suggests that the study is an empirical investigation, as it involves collecting data on specific variables (hydration status) using a particular method (bioelectrical impedance analysis). The abstract also mentions examining relationships between hydration status and clinical variables, which implies a quantitative or experimental approach. Additionally, the use of \"observational study\" in the title suggests that the study is empirical in nature.\n",

      "Study Type: ** Mixed-method study\n",
      "Study Type Justification: ** I classified this study as a mixed-methods study because the title mentions \"mixed-method\" explicitly, which suggests that both qualitative and quantitative data were collected. Additionally, the abstract does not mention specific numerical results or statistical analyses, which is typical of empirical studies focused on presenting findings. Instead, it highlights the need for palliative care in Bhutan, which implies a more exploratory approach, often characteristic of mixed-methods studies.\n",
