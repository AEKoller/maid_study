Self-help empowers people to utilise different coping strategies and implement life changes without reliance on a clinical intervention, ""helping people to help themselves"". Self-help toolkits contain a variety of items that are selected by the person to help them manage the urge to self-harm. The items included sensory objects, distractions, prompts to seek help and creative prompts such as colouring books and pens and personal items that trigger positive memories. AMED, EMBASE, APA Psycinfo and MEDLINE were searched with no language restriction or date restriction. Of the 368 studies screened, 13 met the inclusion criteria. The studies were mainly small scale or case studies pertaining to the use of self-help toolkits or similar. They described the need for a flexible and/or individualised approach to self-help toolkits. Abstracts and studies were screened separately by two members of the research team for inclusion. Qualitative data was analysed using Grounded Theory. Nine themes were identified: Creativity, Hope, Social contact/help seeking, calming/relaxing, sensory items, reflection, distractions, therapeutic prompts and emotional release. Self-efficacy and self-awareness were the two main mechanisms identified. Self-help toolkits were found to be acceptable and helpful, but the limited evidence base means their efficacy for reducing self-harm episodes has not been established.",Issues in mental health nursing,2024,"Experimental, Review, Qualitative",Empirical

39093520,Canada's Medical Assistance in Dying System can Enable Healthcare Serial Killing.,"The Canadian approach to assisted dying, Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD), as of early 2024, is assessed for its ability to protect patients from criminal healthcare serial killing (HSK) to evaluate the strength of its safeguards. MAiD occurs through euthanasia or self-administered assisted suicide (EAS) and is legal or considered in many countries and jurisdictions. Clinicians involved in HSK typically target patients with the same clinical features as MAiD-eligible patients. They may draw on similar rationales, e.g., to end perceived patient suffering and provide pleasure for the clinician. HSK can remain undetected or unconfirmed for considerable periods owing to a lack of staff background checks, poor surveillance and oversight, and a failure by authorities to act on concerns from colleagues, patients, or witnesses. The Canadian MAiD system, effectively euthanasia-based, has similar features with added opportunities for killing afforded by clinicians' exemption from criminal culpability for homicide and assisted suicide offences amid broad patient eligibility criteria. An assessment of the Canadian model offers insights for enhancing safeguards and detecting abuses in there and other jurisdictions with or considering legal EAS. Short of an unlikely recriminalization of EAS, better clinical safeguarding measures, standards, vetting and training of those involved in MAiD, and a radical restructuring of its oversight and delivery can help mitigate the possibility of abuses in a system mandated to accommodate homicidal clinicians.",HEC forum : an interdisciplinary journal on hospitals' ethical and legal issues,2024,Unclassified,Theoretical
39087246,Resilience and Engagement in Crisis: Fostering Trauma-Informed Care and Patient Partnerships Into the Future.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted patient engagement and exposed long-standing inequities within Canada's healthcare system. As a patient partner and caregiver, the author reflects on the exacerbated challenges during the pandemic, particularly for hardly reached communities and those managing chronic conditions. The crisis highlighted the absence of opportunities for patient partnership, with healthcare organizations halting engagement activities despite an increased need for communication and community involvement. The pandemic underlined the necessity of trauma-informed care and engagement-capable environments (ECE). To address these challenges, the author advocates for integrating trauma-informed practices with ECEs, thereby promoting a healthcare model that is both structurally supportive and responsive to individual trauma and resilience. By focusing on compassion, recognizing trauma and fostering engagement, such an approach could enhance patient outcomes and create a more adaptive, inclusive healthcare environment.",HealthcarePapers,2024,Unclassified,Theoretical

39060033,Legal Implications of Psychiatric Assessment for Medical Aid in Dying.,"In recent years, several jurisdictions have passed legislation to permit medical aid in dying (MAID) worldwide, with considerable expansion in the availability of this practice. MAID has been defined as the practice of a clinician prescribing lethal drugs in response to a direct request from the patient, with a shared understanding that the patient intends to use the medication to bring about the patient's death. Wider legalization of MAID has prompted debates and legal controversies regarding the extent to which MAID should be available and its application for people experiencing mental illness as the primary indication. This article examines shifting attitudes of professional medical organizations toward MAID. We discuss the existing statutory provisions for psychiatric assessment for MAID in the United States and the implications on such assessments should MAID be expanded to include mental illness as the primary indication. This article also assesses legal disputes concerning MAID regulations and explores the role of psychiatric experts in the practice of MAID.",The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,2024,Unclassified,Theoretical

However, a consensus conceptualization of the phenomenon is lacking. In the current paper, we offer such a conceptualization by reviewing and integrating knowledge from terminology, available descriptions, and first qualitative findings. Boredom with life, aversion towards life, meaninglessness, and fatigue are identified as central components of the phenomenon. Per component, we describe how the component was identified, our definition of the component and its foundation in descriptions in the literature, and empirical studies on how the component relates to euthanasia requests and suicidality. Moreover, hypotheses on the structure of the phenomenon are outlined, such as on interactions among and the importance of the different components.",Psychological reports,2024,Qualitative,Theoretical

A systematic/narrative literature review.,"The use of clinical ethics services (CES) has been increasing over time, but little is known about the role of CES in cancer care. Cancer diagnosis and treatment are emotionally charged and life-changing experiences, raising existential and ethical questions about the quality and meaning of, living and dying. This narrative review seeks to consolidate the available information regarding how CES are accessed and used in cancer care. The review attempts to answer the question, 'What is known about the role of CES in cancer care?' Papers included in this review were identified through searching PubMed and MEDLINE Ovid; a variety of keywords were used to ensure the capture of all relevant literature. 387 papers were identified using the search strategy, 13 papers were included in the final synthesis following the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Citation searching was conducted. 11 of 13 papers were conducted in the USA, 1 in Germany and 1 in South Korea. A variety of study designs were incorporated into this review. Five key roles of CES in cancer care were identified; conflict resolution/mediation, delivery of ethics education to clinical staff, advising on specific aspects of care, guideline development/resource allocation and emotional support of clinicians. This narrative review outlines how CES can assist clinicians to reflect on, better understand and address, the complex ethical dimensions of their practice. The identified literature demonstrates that early involvement of CES may reduce conflict.

In this retrospective study, we examined the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), by age group and sex, in a cohort of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 20,417), with second-generation antipsychotics, in a South Brazilian State database (Paraná-Brazil). We performed a linkage with the Brazilian Mortality Information System database between 2020 and 2021. We also assessed in a logistic regression how clozapine could affect COVID-19 mortality controlling by sex, age, and presence of obesity. A secondary analysis was to compare mortality with SMR due to COVID-19 in individuals with and without obesity. Compared to the State population (8,850,682 individuals), those with schizophrenia had more than two times greater risk of dying from COVID-19 (SMR = 2.21, 95 % CI: 1.90-2.55). Between the ages of 16 and 29, their risk is more than ten times higher than the state population (SMR = 10.18, 95 % CI: 4.73-19.33). Obesity showed an almost twofold risk of dying from COVID-19 in the patient's group (OR = 1.89, 95 % CI: 1.39-2.57). Clozapine was not found as a protector or a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. In Brazil, a middle-income nation, people with schizophrenia are more likely to die prematurely from COVID-19. The burden of schizophrenia is higher in younger and in patients with obesity.",Schizophrenia research,2024,Observational,Empirical

39012365,The Experiences of Migrant Care Workers in Long-term Care Facilities: A Scoping Review.,"The employment of migrant care workers provides a remedy to face the challenges of increased demand for care of older adults. A scoping review aimed to identify, categorize, and summarize the existing knowledge about migrant care workers' working experiences in long-term care facilities. Identifying gaps in the literature can inform future research. Five electronic databases were searched in April 2024 in addition to a manual search for articles published in English. Forty-five articles were reviewed. A few studies described migrant care assistants' main tasks as assisting physical care and care assistants' characteristics grouped into personal and acquired qualities to provide good quality care. Migrant care workers experienced work satisfaction, achievement, adaptability and adjustment, organizational support, work burden, sense of loneliness, low wages, low social status, and loss of profession. They faced challenges involving inadequate knowledge of palliative care, communication and language barriers, cultural and religious differences, and health concerns. Friendly and discriminatory relationships were found between migrant care workers and stakeholders. Existing evidence regarding the experiences of migrant care workers in delivering palliative care to dying residents or facilitating death preparation is limited. Additionally, there is a notable absence of data from the perspectives of employers and residents on discrimination issues. Further research is necessary to investigate these areas.",Journal of immigrant and minority health,2024,Unclassified,Empirical

This article discusses Australian VAD eligibility criteria that are problematic for people with dementia: (1) time until death within 12 months, (2) decision-making capacity for VAD, and (3) determination of intolerable suffering. Legislation in the Netherlands allows VAD for people with dementia. The challenges and philosophical issues raised by such cases are explored. It is proposed that the unique nature of dementia in its various forms warrants the formulation of dementia-specific VAD eligibility criteria. A case could be brought to challenge the denial of access to VAD of people with dementia on the basis that their exclusion is discriminatory and an abuse of human rights. If such a challenge was successful, it could form a common law precedent to allow people with dementia access to VAD.",Journal of law and medicine,2024,Unclassified,Theoretical

However, ss 474.29A and 474.29B of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) prohibit the use of ""carriage services"" to promote or provide instructions about suicide and may impede access to voluntary assisted dying (VAD). Attempts to clarify whether VAD is suicide have been unsuccessful and doctors risk prosecution if they use telehealth to participate in VAD. This article examines specific steps in the VAD pathway that are likely to breach the federal law. Although there have been attempts to clarify what information can permissibly be discussed using a carriage service, doctors risk breaching the federal law at multiple stages of the VAD process.

Although there are very few cases in the world where prisoners have received euthanasia, the one we will discuss in this article is the only known case where both the public prosecutor's office and the private prosecutors judicially opposed the defendant's euthanasia. This article aims to offer a new perspective on the ethical legitimacy of detainees' access to euthanasia: the ethics of caring solidarity. To do this, we will first place the case in its legal context. Subsequently, we will address the two main arguments proposed in the literature to justify euthanasia in detention: respect for the autonomy of the detainee and the principle of equivalence of care. Finally, after having identified serious shortcomings in both arguments, we will argue that the perspective of caring solidarity offers a better ethical basis for people in detention's access to euthanasia.",Bioethics,2024,Unclassified,Theoretical

38869817,Nurses and Voluntary Assisted Dying: How the Australian Capital Territory's Law Could Change the Australian Regulatory Landscape.,"On June 5, 2024, the Australian Capital Territory passed a law to permit voluntary assisted dying (""VAD""). The Australian Capital Territory became the first Australian jurisdiction to permit nurse practitioners to assess eligibility for VAD. Given evidence of access barriers to VAD in Australia, including difficulty finding a doctor willing to assist, the Australian Capital Territory's approach should prompt consideration of whether the role of nurses in VAD should be expanded in other Australian jurisdictions. Drawing on lessons from Canada, which currently permits nurse practitioners to assess patient eligibility, we argue that the time has come for Australian jurisdictions to expand the role of nurses in VAD systems. This would be an important step in ensuring access to VAD for patients in practice. Attention, however, must also be paid to ensuring adequate remuneration of nurses (and doctors) if this goal of promoting access is to be achieved in practice.",Journal of bioethical inquiry,2024,Unclassified,Empirical
