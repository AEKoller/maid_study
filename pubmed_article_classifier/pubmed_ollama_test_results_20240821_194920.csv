,39167528,10.1089/jpm.2023.0706,"Survey, Randomized Controlled Trial","The study used a randomized controlled trial design to compare the responses of patients who were presented with scenarios related to medical aid in dying versus those who did not receive such information. A survey was administered to collect data on patient trust and other relevant variables. This design allows for causality inference and helps to establish a clear link between legalizing medical aid in dying and changes in patient trust. The use of a randomized controlled trial adds rigor to the study and minimizes potential biases, making it a well-designed empirical investigation.",Empirical,"The study is an empirical investigation that aims to examine the impact of legalizing medical aid in dying on patient trust. It involves collecting data through a survey and analyzing it to draw conclusions, making it an empirical study.",The Impact of Legalizing Medical Aid in Dying on Patient Trust: A Randomized Controlled Survey Study.
"Oral fluid intake decreases in advanced cancer in the dying phase of illness. There is inadequate evidence to support the assessment, and management, of hydration in the dying. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a body composition assessment tool. BIA has the potential to inform clinal management in advanced cancer, by examining the relationships between hydration status and clinical variables.",39160544,10.1186/s12904-024-01542-z,Observation,"The researchers used bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as a non-invasive technology to assess hydration status in advanced cancer patients. This method allowed them to collect data on the participants' fluid status without causing harm or discomfort. Additionally, the observational nature of the study enabled the researchers to examine the relationships between hydration status and clinical variables without manipulating any variables, which is consistent with an observational study design.",Empirical,"The study is empirical because it collects primary data through the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and observational methods to explore relationships between fluid status and symptoms in advanced cancer patients. The study aims to gather new information about the relationship between hydration status and clinical variables, which is characteristic of an empirical study.",Non-invasive technology to assess hydration status in advanced cancer to explore relationships between fluid status and symptoms: an observational study using bioelectrical impedance analysis.
"The death of a patient negatively affects the professional dimension of nurses' functioning and also their private lives, where professional experiences and emotions are often transmitted.",39157533,10.3389/fpubh.2024.1399025,Survey,The study employed a survey method to collect data from nurses about their experiences and emotions when dealing with patients' deaths. This method allows for quantifiable data and enables researchers to reach a large number of participants.,Empirical,"The study is empirical because it presents original research data collected through specific methods to investigate the readiness of nurses when faced with a patient's death. It does not rely on existing literature or theoretical frameworks to make arguments, but rather seeks to explore and describe the phenomenon through data collection.",Readiness of nurses when faced with a patient's death.
"The need for palliative care is ever-increasing globally. However, it is least developed or not available in most low-and-middle-income-countries including Bhutan.",39157418,10.1177/26323524241272102,"Survey, Interview","The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative methods. The survey method was likely used to collect numerical data from a larger sample size of healthcare professionals, while the interview method provided in-depth, nuanced insights into their perceptions and experiences. This combination of methods allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the topic and increased the validity of the findings.",Empirical,"The study is classified as empirical because it involves collecting data through various methods (qualitative and quantitative) to explore healthcare professionals' perceptions on the need for palliative care in Bhutan. The study does not focus on theoretical frameworks or literature reviews, but rather aims to gather original data to answer specific research questions.",'There is no such word as palliative care for us at the moment': A mixed-method study exploring the perceptions of healthcare professionals on the need for palliative care in Bhutan.
"Patients with serious illness frequently report (temporary) wishes to hasten death. Even until the end-of-life, many patients also harbor a will to live. Although both phenomena are negatively correlated according to some studies, they can also co-exist. Knowledge about the complex relationship between the seemingly opposing wish to hasten death and will to live is limited, but crucial for delivering adequate care and understanding potential requests for assisted dying.",39152645,10.1177/02692163241269689,Unable to determine,"The researchers used a mixed-methods approach to collect data on patients' experiences with serious illness. Specifically, they conducted a secondary analysis of outlier patients from an existing study, likely meaning that they re-analyzed data from a previous study to identify and examine patients who did not fit typical patterns or expectations. This method allowed the researchers to gain insight into the complex relationship between the wish to hasten death and the will to live in patients with serious illness.",Empirical,"The study is empirical because it involves data collection and analysis from a real-world setting, specifically a mixed-methods study. This type of study allows for the exploration of complex relationships between variables in a naturalistic context.",The double awareness of the wish to hasten death and the will to live: A secondary analysis of outlier patients from a mixed-methods study.
