While this concern remains influential, it has been subject to limited empirical scrutiny. <b><i>Objectives:</i></b> This study aims to empirically assess whether MAID legalization undermines patient trust, with considerations of potential trust/demographic correlations in marginalized and minority patient populations. <b><i>Design:</i></b> We developed an RCT survey study that assessed patients' trust in the medical professional using the Abbreviated Wake Forest Scale ("AWFS"). Two versions of the survey were used, each distributed at random to half of participants. One survey version included notification that MAID had been legalized in the jurisdiction where patients were receiving care and the other version omitted this information. <b><i>Setting/Population:</i></b> We surveyed capacitated, English-speaking adult patients who were receiving care at a not-for-profit, 912-bed academic and research hospital in Washington, D.C. Of those invited to participate, 494 patients (63.2%) completed all AWFS questions, and 70.1% identified as Black or African American and 32.9% as having a physical or mental disability. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Most of the participants not notified that MAID was legal in DC were not aware of this fact (92.5%). Patients who were notified that MAID was legal in DC were significantly more likely to report approval of MAID legalization (<i>p</i> = 0.0410), but showed no significant difference in AWFS score for trust in their physicians. The study did not substantiate concerns that legalizing medical aid in dying undermines patient trust in the medical profession.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Anderson</LastName><ForeName>Jessica B</ForeName><Initials>JB</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Cacciapuoti</LastName><ForeName>Maria</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, New York, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Day</LastName><ForeName>Hannah</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, California, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hashemzadeh</LastName><ForeName>Taymour</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>NYU Langone Health, New York, New York, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Krohmal</LastName><ForeName>Benjamin J</ForeName><Initials>BJ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>John J.
