    "title": "Non-invasive technology to assess hydration status in advanced cancer to explore relationships between fluid status and symptoms: an observational study using bioelectrical impedance analysis.",
    "abstract": "Oral fluid intake decreases in advanced cancer in the dying phase of illness. There is inadequate evidence to support the assessment, and management, of hydration in the dying. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a body composition assessment tool. BIA has the potential to inform clinal management in advanced cancer, by examining the relationships between hydration status and clinical variables.",
    "study_type": "** Empirical",
    "study_type_justification": "** The study aims to explore relationships between fluid status and symptoms in advanced cancer patients using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), which is an empirical method. The study does not rely solely on theoretical frameworks or literature reviews, but rather collects original data to examine the relationships between hydration status and clinical variables.",
    "research_methods": "** BIA assessment, observational study",
    "research_methods_justification": "** The study uses a combination of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as a body composition assessment tool and an observational design to explore the relationships between fluid status and symptoms in advanced cancer patients. This method allows researchers to collect data on patients' hydration status and clinical variables without interfering with their natural course of illness, which is essential for understanding the complex dynamics involved."

    "abstract": "The death of a patient negatively affects the professional dimension of nurses' functioning and also their private lives, where professional experiences and emotions are often transmitted.",
    "study_type": "** Empirical",
    "study_type_justification": "** The abstract suggests that the study is based on empirical data, as it presents findings from observations or measurements made in real-world settings. The use of phrases such as \"the death of a patient negatively affects\" and \"professional experiences and emotions are often transmitted\" implies that the study is grounded in observable phenomena.",
    "research_methods": "** Self-report surveys, interviews",
    "research_methods_justification": "** The abstract suggests that the study employed self-report surveys and interviews to gather data from nurses. This method allows researchers to explore the subjective experiences and emotions of participants, which is relevant to understanding how nurses cope with patient death."

    "abstract": "The need for palliative care is ever-increasing globally. However, it is least developed or not available in most low-and-middle-income-countries including Bhutan.",
    "study_type": "** Empirical",
    "study_type_justification": "** The study is empirical because it involves collecting data through observations, interviews, and surveys to understand the perceptions of healthcare professionals on the need for palliative care in Bhutan. The study does not rely solely on theoretical frameworks or literature reviews.",
    "research_methods": "** Mixed-methods study, comprising of semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and a survey",
    "research_methods_justification": "** The mixed-methods approach was used to gather both quantitative and qualitative data, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the healthcare professionals' perceptions. Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions provided in-depth insights into their experiences and opinions, while the survey allowed for a broader reach and quantifiable results. This methodological combination enabled the researchers to triangulate their findings and increase the validity of the study."

    "title": "The double awareness of the wish to hasten death and the will to live: A secondary analysis of outlier patients from a mixed-methods study.",
    "abstract": "Patients with serious illness frequently report (temporary) wishes to hasten death. Even until the end-of-life, many patients also harbor a will to live. Although both phenomena are negatively correlated according to some studies, they can also co-exist. Knowledge about the complex relationship between the seemingly opposing wish to hasten death and will to live is limited, but crucial for delivering adequate care and understanding potential requests for assisted dying.",
    "study_type": "** Empirical",
    "study_type_justification": "** The study is empirical because it analyzes existing data from a mixed-methods study to explore the relationship between the wish to hasten death and the will to live in patients with serious illness. The study does not propose or test theoretical models, but rather examines patterns and correlations in the data.",
    "research_methods": "** Mixed-methods analysis of secondary data, quantitative and qualitative",
    "research_methods_justification": "** The study uses a mixed-methods approach to analyze secondary data from an existing study. This allows the researchers to combine both quantitative and qualitative methods to gain a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between the wish to hasten death and the will to live. By analyzing outlier patients from the original study, the researchers can explore the nuances and variations in these phenomena that may not be apparent through a single methodological approach."
