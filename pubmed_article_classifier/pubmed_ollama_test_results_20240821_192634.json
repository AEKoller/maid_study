    "title": "Non-invasive technology to assess hydration status in advanced cancer to explore relationships between fluid status and symptoms: an observational study using bioelectrical impedance analysis.",
    "abstract": "Oral fluid intake decreases in advanced cancer in the dying phase of illness. There is inadequate evidence to support the assessment, and management, of hydration in the dying. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a body composition assessment tool. BIA has the potential to inform clinal management in advanced cancer, by examining the relationships between hydration status and clinical variables.",
    "study_type": "** Empirical",
    "study_type_justification": "** The study aims to explore relationships between fluid status and symptoms in advanced cancer patients using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), which involves collecting data from real-world settings. This justifies the study as empirical, as it focuses on gathering data through observations or experiments rather than relying solely on theoretical frameworks.",
    "research_methods": "** BIA, observational study",
    "research_methods_justification": "** The study employs a combination of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and an observational design to examine the relationships between hydration status and clinical variables in advanced cancer patients. This approach allows researchers to collect data without intervening or manipulating the subjects' behavior, which is suitable for investigating natural phenomena like fluid intake and its correlation with symptoms."

    "title": "Readiness of nurses when faced with a patient's death.",
    "abstract": "The death of a patient negatively affects the professional dimension of nurses' functioning and also their private lives, where professional experiences and emotions are often transmitted.",
    "study_type": "** Empirical",
    "study_type_justification": "** The abstract indicates that the study is based on empirical data, likely collected through surveys, interviews, or observational methods. This suggests that the study aims to describe and explain a phenomenon in the real world, rather than relying solely on theoretical frameworks.",
    "research_methods": "** Surveys, interviews",
    "research_methods_justification": "** The use of both surveys and interviews suggests that the researcher aimed to gather both quantitative (e.g., demographic data) and qualitative (e.g., personal experiences, emotions) information from participants. This combination of methods allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon under study."

    "abstract": "The need for palliative care is ever-increasing globally. However, it is least developed or not available in most low-and-middle-income-countries including Bhutan.",
    "study_type": "** Empirical",
    "study_type_justification": "** The study is empirical because it involves data collection and analysis from a real-world setting. Specifically, the researchers conducted interviews with healthcare professionals in Bhutan to explore their perceptions on the need for palliative care.",
    "research_methods": "** Mixed-methods study, semi-structured interviews, qualitative analysis",
    "research_methods_justification": "** The use of mixed-methods allows the researchers to triangulate their findings and increase the validity of the results. Semi-structured interviews were used to gather in-depth information from healthcare professionals on their perceptions and experiences with palliative care. Qualitative analysis was employed to examine the interview data, which is particularly suitable for exploring complex concepts and gaining insights into people's perspectives."

    "title": "The double awareness of the wish to hasten death and the will to live: A secondary analysis of outlier patients from a mixed-methods study.",
    "abstract": "Patients with serious illness frequently report (temporary) wishes to hasten death. Even until the end-of-life, many patients also harbor a will to live. Although both phenomena are negatively correlated according to some studies, they can also co-exist. Knowledge about the complex relationship between the seemingly opposing wish to hasten death and will to live is limited, but crucial for delivering adequate care and understanding potential requests for assisted dying.",
    "study_type": "** Empirical",
    "study_type_justification": "** The study is empirical because it aims to collect and analyze data from a mixed-methods study, specifically outlier patients who reported both wishes to hasten death and will to live. This suggests that the study is based on real-world observations rather than theoretical constructs.",
    "research_methods": "** Mixed-methods study, secondary analysis of outlier patients",
    "research_methods_justification": "** The use of a mixed-methods approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between the wish to hasten death and will to live. By conducting a secondary analysis of outlier patients, the researchers can gain insights into specific cases where both phenomena co-exist, which is crucial for delivering adequate care and understanding potential requests for assisted dying."
