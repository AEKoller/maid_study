"Oral fluid intake decreases in advanced cancer in the dying phase of illness. There is inadequate evidence to support the assessment, and management, of hydration in the dying. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a body composition assessment tool. BIA has the potential to inform clinal management in advanced cancer, by examining the relationships between hydration status and clinical variables.",10.1186/s12904-024-01542-z,39160544,"** Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), clinical variables, advanced cancer, dying phase of illness","** The study uses BIA as a non-invasive technology to assess hydration status in participants with advanced cancer. This method is justified because it allows for the examination of relationships between fluid status and symptoms, which is relevant to the research question. Additionally, the inclusion of clinical variables provides context and helps to understand the significance of the findings.",** Empirical,"** The study is empirical because it involves collecting and analyzing data from a sample of participants, in this case, individuals with advanced cancer. The researchers are exploring the relationship between hydration status and symptoms, which requires observational data to be collected.",Non-invasive technology to assess hydration status in advanced cancer to explore relationships between fluid status and symptoms: an observational study using bioelectrical impedance analysis.
"The death of a patient negatively affects the professional dimension of nurses' functioning and also their private lives, where professional experiences and emotions are often transmitted.",10.3389/fpubh.2024.1399025,39157533,"Self-reported measures, surveys, interviews","The abstract mentions that professional experiences and emotions are often transmitted between the private and professional lives of nurses. This suggests that the study may have used self-reported measures, such as surveys or interviews, to gather data on how nurses perceive their readiness when faced with a patient's death.",Empirical,"The abstract suggests that it is based on real-world data and observations, which is characteristic of empirical research. The study appears to be a quantitative or qualitative investigation into how nurses are affected by patient deaths.",Readiness of nurses when faced with a patient's death.
"The need for palliative care is ever-increasing globally. However, it is least developed or not available in most low-and-middle-income-countries including Bhutan.",10.1177/26323524241272102,39157418,"** Surveys, Interviews, Mixed-Methods","** The mixed-methods design allows the researchers to collect both quantitative and qualitative data, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the perceptions of healthcare professionals on palliative care in Bhutan. The survey method enables the collection of data from a larger sample size, while the interview method allows for in-depth exploration of individual perspectives and experiences.",** Empirical,"** The study is empirical because it collects data through mixed-methods, including surveys and interviews, to explore the perceptions of healthcare professionals on the need for palliative care in Bhutan. This approach allows for the collection of primary data that is analyzed to draw conclusions about the topic.",'There is no such word as palliative care for us at the moment': A mixed-method study exploring the perceptions of healthcare professionals on the need for palliative care in Bhutan.
"Patients with serious illness frequently report (temporary) wishes to hasten death. Even until the end-of-life, many patients also harbor a will to live. Although both phenomena are negatively correlated according to some studies, they can also co-exist. Knowledge about the complex relationship between the seemingly opposing wish to hasten death and will to live is limited, but crucial for delivering adequate care and understanding potential requests for assisted dying.",10.1177/02692163241269689,39152645,** Secondary analysis of outlier patients from a mixed-methods study,"** The researcher is building upon previous research by analyzing a subset of participants (outliers) who exhibited complex or contradictory responses regarding their wishes for hastening death and their will to live. This approach allows the investigator to delve deeper into specific cases and explore the nuances of these phenomena in more detail. The use of mixed-methods suggests that both quantitative and qualitative data were collected, potentially including surveys, interviews, or observational measures.",** Empirical,"** The study is considered empirical because it is based on data collection and analysis, rather than solely relying on theoretical frameworks or philosophical discussions. The use of mixed-methods and secondary analysis suggests that the study aims to explore a phenomenon through systematic observation and measurement.",The double awareness of the wish to hasten death and the will to live: A secondary analysis of outlier patients from a mixed-methods study.
